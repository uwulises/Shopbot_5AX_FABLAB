The files in this folder are sample files that are used
  in the Part File Programming portion of the Introductory
  ShopBot CNC training.

These files are intended to be studied in PREVIEW MODE and
  are not intended to actually cut material.

A more extensive introduction can be found in the ShopBot
  Users Guide and then in more advanced form in the 
  ShopBot Programming Handbook. Both can be accessed from
  HELP in the ShopBot software.
