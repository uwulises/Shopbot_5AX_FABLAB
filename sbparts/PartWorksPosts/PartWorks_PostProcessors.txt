PostProcessors are installed when you install PartWorks Design Software or PartWorks Design Software Updates.

Periodically, however, ShopBot will issues updates to these PostProcessors and includes them with any install of ShopBot Control Software. The most recent standard PostProcessors can be found in the folder-  C:\SbParts\PartWorksPosts
Previous and specialized PostProcessors can be found in the folder-  C:\SbParts\PartWorksPosts\Archive

In order for these posts to work correctly in PartWorks, they will need to be copied into the correct folder:

For PartWorks 3.0 and later-
	C:\ProgramData\Vectric\PartWorks\V3.x\PostP

For earlier PartWorks Versions-
        C:\ProgramFiles\ShopBot\PartWorks xx\PostP
