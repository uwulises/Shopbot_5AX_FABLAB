PostProcessors for V-CarvePro ShopBot Edition (by Vectric) are installed in the correct location when you install V-CarvePro or updates.

We include the current version of the V-CarvePro postprocessors in this folder as a backup. You will need to install or copy any postprocessor to the correct folder for it to work with the software (see the software documentation for locations).

There are just two standard posts for Vectric products:
   ShopBot_TC_inch.pp
   ShopBot_TC_mm.pp

In this folder, we also include speciality post processors for Vectric software. These postprocessors will also need to be installed in the correct location for them to function.
