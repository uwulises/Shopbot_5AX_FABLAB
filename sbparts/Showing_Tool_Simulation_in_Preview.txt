Applies to ShopBot Control Software 3.6.34 and later.
-----------------------------------------------------

ShopBot's Preview system shows the track of any toolpath in a part file. It is also capable of simulating the effect of a cutter and displaying exactly what a part will look like when machined.

ShopBot's Design Software is set up to format PartFiles so that these preview capabilites are fully supported in posted files. Make sure you are using ShopBot Software 3.6.34 or later.


Using Files from other software in Preview, or writing your own files.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The simulation feature of the Previewer can be used manually by clicking simulate and choosing a cutter from the library. This only allows simulation of one tool path at a time.

Posts from other software, and files written manually, can be given these capabilities if the following comment lines exemplified here are inserted into the PartFile. Note that to work correctly, the cutter name must =exactly= match the name of a cutter defined in the tooldatabase.

'New Path
'Toolpath Name = myToolPath
'Tool Name   = Name of a Cutter from Tool database


Line Numbering in Preview Mode.
------------------------------
Note that in addition to displaying the tool path, in preview mode you can explore the exact location of the cutter tip by moving your mose cursor to the location you wish to sample. In addition, you are given the exact line number of that segment of the file. This sampling in preview provides a good way to indentify the restart point for a file that you want to run from the middle of the file using the [FG] Command.
